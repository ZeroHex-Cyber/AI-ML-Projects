# Week 4 â€“ **AI Chatbot** using *Python*.

This project is a **rule-based chatbot** built using Python as part of my AI/ML internship. 
It uses predefined responses for specific inputs without any machine learning models.

---

##  Objective

Develop a chatbot using Python (either rule-based or ML-based).  
This implementation is rule-based and handles simple conversations based on hardcoded mappings.

---

##  Files Included

- `ChatBot.py` - Main Python script for the chatbot.
- `Chat_history.txt` - Stores the chat log between the user and the bot.
- `ChatResponses.json` - JSON file containing predefined questions and their responses

---

##  Dataset

The dataset is stored in a JSON file.
Contains **15+ hardcoded question-response pairs**.

##  How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download this folder
2. Open terminal or IDE.
3. Run the chatbot using:
```bash
    python ChatBot.py
```
