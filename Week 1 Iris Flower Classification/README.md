# Week 1 – Iris Flower Classifier 

This project focuses on classifying iris flowers into three species using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. It's part of a weekly AI/ML internship program.

---

##  Objective

Build a classification model to predict the species of an iris flower using sepal and petal length/width.

---

##  Files Included

- `Iris Flower Classifier.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook with code and outputs

---

##  Dataset

The Iris dataset includes 150 rows with the following features:
- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)
- Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)
